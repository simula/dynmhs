Description: Dynamic Multi-Homing Setup (DynMHS)
 DynMHS dynamically sets up IP routing rules, to allow using multiple
 network connections simultaneously. That is, for each relevant network
 interface, a separate routing table is created and maintained. For each
 source address of a network interface managed by DynMHS, routing rules
 are maintained to point to the corresponding routing table. Software
 binding to a specific interface address can then use a specific
 network. In addition, multi-homing-capable network protocols like the
 Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) or the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
 can take advantage of multi-homing for redundancy and load balancing.
